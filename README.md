## üöÄ Project Overview

`MyPersonalEcommerce` is a feature-rich e-commerce application developed using the **Django framework**. It provides a multi-faceted platform catering to three distinct user roles: **Administrators**, **Merchants**, and **Customers**. The core design prioritizes **security**, incorporating measures like data encryption, input validation, brute-force protection, and secure authentication flows, while offering essential e-commerce functionalities. The application also features dynamic theming options, including a vibrant "Neon Spectrum" mode.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security First Approach

Security is a cornerstone of this platform. Key implemented measures include:

* üîë **Robust Authentication & Authorization:**
    * Distinct login portals and dashboards for Customers and Merchants.
    * Strict role-based access control (RBAC) enforced via middleware and decorators (`@user_passes_test`).
    * Secure handling of user sessions and authentication tokens.
    * Integration with `django-allauth` for streamlined social login (Google implemented).
* üîí **Data Encryption:**
    * Sensitive user data (e.g., address, phone number in `Order` model) is encrypted at rest using `fernet_fields` and a strong encryption key (`FERNET_KEY` in settings).
    * Secure key management practices are essential for production (e.g., environment variables, KMS). A Celery task (`rotate_keys`) is stubbed out for future key rotation implementation.
* üõ°Ô∏è **Input Validation & Sanitization:**
    * Django forms (`forms.py`) enforce data types, lengths, and specific formats (e.g., phone numbers, addresses).
    * Use of `bleach` library to sanitize user-generated content (like product descriptions, reviews) against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Rate Limiting & Brute-Force Protection:**
    * Integration with `django-axes` to monitor and block suspicious login activity based on failed attempts per username.
* ü§ñ **CAPTCHA Integration:**
    * Utilizes `django-simple-captcha` on critical forms (Registration, Login) to prevent automated bot submissions.
* üì© **Secure Password Recovery:**
    * Implemented an Email-based One-Time Password (OTP) system for secure password resets. OTPs are time-limited and marked as used.
* üñºÔ∏è **Image Security:**
    * Image uploads are handled, and Pillow library is used to resize large images, mitigating potential denial-of-service risks from overly large files.
* üîê **CSRF Protection:** Django's built-in Cross-Site Request Forgery protection is enabled via middleware.
* **Logging:** Comprehensive logging is configured to track application events, errors, and security-related incidents.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into three main Django apps within the `ecommerce` project directory:

1.  **`ecommerce` (Main Project App):**
    * Contains project-wide settings (`settings.py`), main URL configuration (`urls.py`), WSGI/ASGI configurations.
    * Holds base templates (`templates/base.html`) and global static files (`static/css/style.css`, `static/js/`, etc.).
    * Includes the vibrant theme CSS (`static/css/vibrant-mode.css`) and associated theme-switching JS in `base.html`.
2.  **`products` App:**
    * Manages product catalog, categories, orders, order items, and reviews.
    * Contains models (`models.py`), views (`views.py`), forms (`forms.py`), URLs (`urls.py`), and templates specific to products, cart, checkout, and order management (`templates/products/`).
    * Includes the shopping cart logic (`cart.py`) and background tasks (`tasks.py`).
3.  **`users` App:**
    * Manages user authentication, profiles, and roles.
    * Defines the `CustomUser` model (`models.py`) extending Django's `AbstractUser`.
    * Contains views (`views.py`) for registration, login (customer & merchant), logout, dashboards, password reset (OTP), and account settings.
    * Includes specific forms (`forms.py`) for authentication and user management.
    * Defines user-related URLs (`urls.py`).
    * Includes utilities for OTP handling (`utils.py`, `sms_utils.py` - though SMS sending might not be fully implemented).

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd MyPersonalEcommerce
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    * Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file. If not, create one: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    * *Note:* If planning to use PostgreSQL, install `psycopg2-binary` or `psycopg2`.

4.  **Configure Environment Variables / Settings:**
    * **Crucially, update `ecommerce/settings.py`:**
        * Set a strong `SECRET_KEY`. **Do not use the insecure default key in production.**
        * Generate a `FERNET_KEY` (`python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"`) and store it securely (e.g., environment variable). Update `settings.FERNET_KEY`.
        * Configure `DATABASES` if using PostgreSQL.
        * Add your Google `client_id` and `secret` for `SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS`.
        * Configure `EMAIL_BACKEND`, `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_HOST_USER`, `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` for email functionality (OTP, etc.). **Use an App Password for Gmail.**
        * Review `ALLOWED_HOSTS` for deployment.
        * Set `DEBUG = False` for production.
    * Consider using a `.env` file and `python-dotenv` to manage these settings securely.

5.  **Apply Database Migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create Superuser (Admin):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    *Follow the prompts. Remember to set the role to 'admin' if managing via the custom admin user interface.*

7.  **Collect Static Files (for production):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```

8.  **Run Development Server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    *Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.*

9.  **(Optional) Setup Celery & Elasticsearch:**
    * If using Celery for background tasks or Elasticsearch (via Haystack) for search, follow their respective setup guides (install Redis/RabbitMQ for Celery broker, setup Elasticsearch instance, run workers, etc.).
